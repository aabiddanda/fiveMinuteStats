# Pre-requisites

You should be familiar with the idea of a Markov chain, and with the [multivariate normal distribution](mvnorm.html).

# Overview

This vignette introduces the idea that in a multivariate normal, conditional independences correspond to the zeros of the precision matrix (inverse covariance matrix). It also prepares you for the idea of Brownian motion.

# A normal markov chain

Consider a Markov chain $X_1,X_2,X_3,\dots$ where the transitions are given by
$X_{t+1} | X_{t} \sim N(X_{t},1)$. You might think of this Markov chain as corresponding to a type of "random walk": given the current state, the next state is obtained by adding a random normal with mean 0 and variance 1. 

The following code simulates a realization of this Markov chain, starting from an initial state $X_1 \sim N(0,1)$, and plots it.

```{r}
set.seed(100)
sim_normal_MC=function(length=1000){
  X = rep(0,length)
  X[1] = rnorm(1)
  for(t in 2:length){
    X[t]= X[t-1] + rnorm(1)  
  }
  return(X)
}
plot(sim_normal_MC())
```

# A normal markov chain as a multivariate normal

If you think a little you should be able to see that the above random walk simulation is actually simulating from a 1000-dimensional multivariate normal distribution!

Why? 

Well, let's write each of the $N(0,1)$ variables we generate using ''rnorm'' in that code as $Z_1,Z_2,\dots$. Then:
$$X_1 = Z_1$$
$$X_2 = X_1 + Z_2 = Z_1 + Z_2$$
$$X_3 = X_2 + Z_3 = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3$$ etc.

So we can write $X = AZ$ where $A$ is the 1000 by 1000 matrix
$$A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \dots \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & \dots \\
\dots
\end{pmatrix}.$$

Let's take a look at what the covariance matrix Sigma looks like. (We get a good idea from just looking
at the top left corner of the matrix what the pattern is)
```{r}
A = matrix(0,nrow=1000,ncol=1000)
for(i in 1:1000){
    A[i,]=c(rep(1,i),rep(0,1000-i))
}
Sigma = A %*% t(A)
Sigma[1:10,1:10]
```

Something interesting happens when we look at the inverse of this covariance matrix, which is referred to as the *precision* matrix, and often denoted $\Omega$. Again
we just show the top left corner of the precision matrix here. 
```{r}
Omega = chol2inv(chol(Sigma))
Omega[1:10,1:10]
```

Notice all the 0s in the precision matrix. This is important! It is an example of the following much more general idea:

Let $X$ be multivariate normal with covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and precision matrix $\Omega = \Sigma^{-1}$. Then 
$$\Omega_{ij}=0 \text{ if and only if } X_i \text{ and } X_j \text{ are conditionally independent given all other coordinates of } X.$$

Also,
$$\Sigma_{ij}=0 \text{ if and only if } X_i \text{ and } X_j \text{ are independent}.$$


That is, the zeros of the covariance matrix tell us about independencies among coordinates of $X$, and zeros of the precision matrix tell us about *conditional* independencies.

In a Markov chain (any Markov chain) the conditional distribution of $X_t$ 
given the other $X_s$ ($s \neq t$) depends only on its neighbors $X_{t-1}$ and $X_{t+1}$. That is, $X_{t}$ is conditionally independent of all other $X_s$ given $X_{t-1}$ and $X_{t+1}$. This is exactly what we are seeing in the precision matrix above:
the non-zero elements of the $t$th row are at coordinates $t-1,t$ and $t+1$.
